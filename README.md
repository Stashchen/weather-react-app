# Weather app

The idea of the app is to test React js skills by creating simple weather app.
You need to type any City, and you will see its weather forecast.

For this project, I have used [MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/)

### To start app, you need:
1. Clone this repo
2. Start dev version or production version:
```
npm start
// or npm start build -- for production
```
